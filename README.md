# CSR-modeling
Complex System Response (CSR) is a modeling approach proposed by Professor Chih-Ming Ho (何志明).

In this project, we aim to apply the CSR approach to build a personalized model for predicting individuals' psychological responses, including those in linguistic tasks and serial reaction time (SRT) tasks. 

With the CSR approach, the number of parameters in the model is significantly reduced, allowing for evaluation using a minimal amount of data — a common characteristic of most individualized datasets.
